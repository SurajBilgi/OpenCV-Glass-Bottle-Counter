## Project Description
This project was part of a broader initiative to leverage AI for improving operational efficiency in the manufacturing industry. My role included delivering POCs, deploying AI solutions on-site, and training AI models for object detection.

### Objectives
- Develop and deploy AI solutions for object detection to count bottles using industry-grade cameras.
- Reduce wastage by improving bottle counting accuracy.
- Increase warehouse efficiency with user-friendly applications.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv4 for accurate object detection and counting.
- **User-friendly GUI**: Developed using Tkinter and PyQT5 for easy interaction and deployment.
- **On-Site Deployment**: AI solutions deployed directly at client locations for real-time application.
- **Data Collection**: Comprehensive data collection at client sites to tailor AI solutions to specific problem statements.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv4**: For object detection.
- **Python**: For backend development and AI model training.
- **Tkinter**: For developing user-friendly applications.
- **PyQT5**: For building GUI applications for client deployment.
- **Industry-grade Cameras**: For accurate data capture and object detection.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python (with necessary libraries such as OpenCV, PyQt5, Tkinter)
- YOLOv4 model files
- Industry-grade cameras

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/object-detection.git
   cd object-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download YOLOv4 Model**
   - Download the YOLOv4 weights and configuration files.
   - Place them in the `models` directory.

4. **Launch the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
### Starting the System
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Connect the industry-grade camera to the system.
3. Run the application using the command mentioned above.
4. Use the GUI for interacting with the system and monitoring object detection.

### Monitoring Object Detection
